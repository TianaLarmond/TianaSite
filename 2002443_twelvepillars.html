        <h4><a name="Chapter4" href="">CHAPTER 4 - ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS</a></h4>
    </center>
    <p>This chapter speaks about how to attain one's goals in life or their career, specifically. Firstly, to successfully achieve 
        anything in life, one must have goals on what they'd like to achieve. This requires utilising goal-setting which is simply put,
        writing down your goals. Writing down your goals implies the existence of a goal in the first place, which, in itself, is a 
        tremendous start. Furthermore, writing down your goal has its own strength. It brings it into reality. One of the most beneficial 
        things you can do is make a list of 100 things you want to complete before you die. The act of deciding what they are is powerful 
        in and of itself, but writing them down increases your chances of attaining them because once your mind is cognizant of them, 
        it goes to work on obtaining them.<br>Begin by altering your course. You are exactly where you are, but you are not bound to remain there.
        Choose your destination and then devise a strategy for getting there. You can set long-term objectives that last around ten years, 
        mid-term goals that last five years, and short-term goals that last a year or two. Micro-goals that are only for a few months 
        can also be included. <br>Just decide what you want to do and then get started. The most important reason for setting a goal is to see 
        what it takes to achieve it. It will always be of far greater worth to you than the goal you reach. <b>The real goal in life is to 
        become a better person. </b>That is one of the most powerful lessons in life.

        <h4><a name="Chapter5" href="">CHAPTER 5 - THE PROPER USE OF TIME</a></h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        This chapter speaks about successful time management so that one can make the most of their day. Each person has to suffer from one 
        of two pains, the pain of <i>discipline</i> or the pain of <i>regret</i>. We all have specific tasks that if we don't achieve during
        our lives, we will have deep regrets. It's imperative that each individual notes that days are expensive. When you spend a day, 
        you have one less day to spend. So make sure you spend each one wisely. There are many opportunities in each day, but only one 
        <i>best</i> opportunity. Your finest prospects should be ones that correspond with your overall aims and on which you should focus 
        your efforts.<br>It is more beneficial to be the master of time rather than vice-versa. We must each be the designer of our lives.
        If you don’t design your own life plan, chances are you will fall into someone else’s plan. <b>Something will always master and
        something else will serve, choose the one you want to be.</b>
    </p>

        <h4><a name="Chapter6" href="">CHAPTER 6 - SURROUND YOURSELF WITH THE BEST PEOPLE</a></h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        This chapter speaks about being mindful of the company one keeps as others behaviour,, good or bad, can rub off on you overtime.
        Surround yourself with winners, successful individuals who demonstrate and exemplify ideals and skills you want to learn and grow. 
        People in your life, you see, have incredible power over your fate. They have a profound impact on you; your friends, your spouse, 
        your coworkers, and your family, all of the people we are surrounded by. It's critical to consider how they impact us. 
        Influence is so subtle; it's like a tiny nudge, and each time you meet up with these people, you receive another nudge in the wrong 
        direction, toward the wrong attitudes, and down the path you don't want to be on.<br>Every relationship
        we each have is an association, and each association has either a positive, neutral or negative effect on us. Therefore, a person who
        wants to be successful has to regularly determine what kind of relationship it is and how to approach that relationship. Each person you 
        meet should be placed in one of three categories, <i>disassociation</i> (stop associating with), <i>limited association 
        and expanded association.</i> Allow yourself to be exposed to a wealth of new information. Knowledge about how the world works, 
        how business operates, and how to improve your connections are all valuable assets. Second, broaden your horizons by joining a 
        large new network.
        <br><b>Always remember, to attract attractive people you must be attractive. To attract powerful people you must be powerful. 
        To attract committed people you must be committed. Instead of going to work on them, go to work on yourself. If you become, 
        you can attract.</b> Attitude is greatly shaped by influence and association.

        <h4><a name="Chapter7" href="">CHAPTER 7 - BE A LIFE-LONG LEARNER</a></h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        This chapter speaks about the concept that a successful person is a life-long learner. Formal education will make you a living; 
        self-education will make you a fortune. If you want to succeed in life, formal education isn't the key, self-education is.
        After your formal schooling, you will live most of your life. After your formal schooling, you will spend the majority of your life. 
        The government requires that each child attends school until the 13th grade, after which most individuals choose to attend university,
        but the genuinely successful prefer to continue learning throughout their careers. What you teach yourself is self-education. 
        It's the lessons you pick up along the way that help you keep improving and progressing.<br>There are a few cornerstones to learning 
        that anyone can use to improve their lives. The first is to <b>read books</b>. The focus shouldn’t be placed on how much the books 
        cost, but instead on what it will cost you if you don’t read them. The second is to <b>learn from successful people by observation</b>. 
        And the third is to <b>constantly reflect on your own experiences and learn what went right and what went wrong</b>.

        <h4><a name="Reflection" href=""><font color="red">REFLECTION: HOW CAN I APPLY THESE PRINCIPLES TO MY LIFE?</font></a></h4>
    </center>
    <p>These 3 out of the 12 pillars of succes that I had to read for this assignment wer very insightful. I am actually happy that this
        reading was required. I now have every intention of not only reading the entire book but also applying these principles to me life.
        <br>In regards to using my time properly, that is something I already do. I set out my schedule for each day in my planner so that 
        I can maximize the work I get done while also being able to occasionally take breaks. This has been very helpful for me as it helps
        me to remember all the task I have to get done each day.<br>The chapter on surrounding myself with the best people really resonated
        with me as I too am sometimes willing to let go of friendships I've had for years despite the negative impacts they have on me.
        This chapter has helped to nudge me in the right direction and has prompted me to analyse my life and those who I surround myself
        with so that I may make the best decision for my mental, spiritual and physical well-being.<br>Being a life-long learner is aready 
        something I was aware that I had to be given that I would like to pursue a career in the technological field. Technology is something 
        that is constantly changing, updating and advancing therefore I have to keep my skills up to par by constantly educating myself.<br>
        In conclusion, this is a book I'd recommend to anybody who wants to live a successful nd happy life. It addresses numerous topics that
        each person should carefully think about.
