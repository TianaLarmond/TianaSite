    <h3 align = "center"><font color="green">PROFESSIONAL VISION</font></h3>
    <p align="center">My vision is focused on becoming a software engineer. I aim to analyze and modify existing software as well as design, 
        construct and test end-user applications that meet user needs (e.g. business applications or computer games) — all through software 
        programming languages. I will also be evaluating the software and systems that make computers and hardware work. </p>
    
    <h3 align = "center"><font color="green">PROFESSIONAL MISSION</font></h3>
    <p align="center">Since I was a child, my mission was always to attend and graduate University with first class honours. My occupation
        however, was something I changed multiple times. Now that I'm positive that software engineering is the field for me and I've started,
        my University education, my aim is to continue excelling in my studies as well as getting work experience pertaining to my field
        study so that I may have the necessary experience and education for companies to hire me.
