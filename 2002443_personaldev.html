    <ol>
        <li><i>Patience</i>: Being patient means that I can deal with delays. This is an important strength to have in life because there 
             are many instances in which interruptions may occur in the work progress. I am capable of waiting and handling setbacks.
            <center><img src="Assets/patience.png" alt="Image stating that Patience is a virtue" width="300"></center></li><br>
        <li><i>Organizational skills</i>: I am able to stay focused on different tasks, and use my time, energy, strength and
            mental capacity effectively and efficiently in order to achieve the desired outcome. which is evident in the fact
            that I go to University full-time while also occassionally working and being the SCIT first year representative.

        <li><i>Communication Skills</i>: Good communication first starts with listening. Not only am I an exemplary listener but I am also
            able to effectively relay information as well as explain information to others. I am always able to successfully 
            articulate my thoughts in a way that others will understand. <center><img src="Assets/effective_communication_skills.png"

    <ol>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Patience</i></font>: This is something that I had struggled with for awhile. For most of my life I was very impatient
            and would stress at the mention of any setbacks. I wanted to do everything immediately and wait for nothing. I knew this
            was a bad trait so overtime I taught myself how to calm myself and occupy myself with other activities when faced with setbacks.
            Setbacks are inevitable in life so it's just up to me on how I respond when faced with them.</li><br>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Organizational skills</i></font>: This is a trait I've had from an early age. I've always been strong at organizing my schedule.
            When I was younger and had less to do I could easily keep all my tasks in mind however, now that I'm older and my workload
            and personal responsibilities have increased, I write down and plan out each taks that I have to carry out. And for the past 3
            years I've invested in planners to help me with this.
            </li><br>
        <li><font color="gold"><i>Communication Skills</i></font>: This is a skill I've had to develop overtime due to me being very shy when I was younger.
            The listening aspect of it was relatively easy for me sincce I was always quiet and therefore readily listened to others
            as I preffered them talking and not me. For the past 5+ years I've slowly but surely broken out of my shell and gained the 
            ability to articulate myself well.</li>
